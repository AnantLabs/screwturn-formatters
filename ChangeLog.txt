Bug fixes:
	FileListFormatter:
				Default provider now works when specifiyng '' or ,, , BUT the default provider is now always the LAST active provider detected, 
				which in most cases will be SQL provider due to the alphabetic order (Local Files, MySql Provider, Oracle Provider, SQL Provider)
	EventLogFormatter:
				Test page has been cut down to 1 simple example as running many examples where to heavy on the server, could kill it.
				NOTE: EventLogFormatter should always be used with causion as the EventLog system is very slow when scanning.

	Major rewrite of Help pages and test pages
