Honours:
-------------------------------------------
These formatters could not have been made without the assistance of:
	fam fam fam icons - http://www.famfamfam.com
	fat cow icons - http://www.fatcow.com/free-icon
	R. Christie stylesheets- http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/08/13/top-10-css-table-designs
	boxstart Admontion plugin - http://www.screwturn.eu/forum/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=7804&sid=95ff256e9f5cf871821638e8f512e164
	and of course - ScrewTurn :)


Requirements:
-------------------------------------------
Theses formatters are ONLY guarenteed to work with ScrewTurn 3.0.2.509 and .Net Framework 3.5. 
However it is assumed that they will work with all 3.0.X.X versions of ScrewTurn.

Beyond that there are now special requirements.

Note: The formatters creates files in your default storage provider and creates a set of help pages, all which will be rewritten if deleted. 
      They can all however be modified without being overwritten as along as they maintain thier original location and name.
	  If you modify the the pages and later update the plugin, the page will be replaced, however your changes will be there historically.

	     
		            
Installation
-------------------------------------------
All formatters are installed using the Administration interface.

 

Upgrading from previous version
-------------------------------------------
Upgrading styles:
	CSS file such as TableStyle.css, which controls the table layout styles, must be delete manually before new styles included in never versions are applied.

Upgrading from version 1.0.1.0:
	All versions after this are a major rewrite. Upgrading WILL require you to rewrite all tags on all pages as the syntax has been altered.
	Original Help+Test pages should be deleted or will be automatically overwritten by never versions of the plugins.



Rights:
-------------------------------------------
I've yet to decide on a license, so until then use as you please as, but at your own risk, I will not be held responsible for any consequences of using these formatters.
Only exception is if you try to make money of my products. In which case my girlfriend, who's a state attorney will sue your ass into hell and back :S.
