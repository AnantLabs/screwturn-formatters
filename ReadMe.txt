Requirements:
-------------------------------------------
Theses formatters are ONLY guarenteed to work with ScrewTurn 3.0.2.509 and .Net Framework 3.5. 
However it is assumed that they will work with all 3.0.X.X versions of ScrewTurn.

Beyond that there are now special requirements.

Note: The formatters creates files in your default storage provider and creates a set of help pages, all which will be rewritten if deleted. 
      They can all however be modified without being overwritten as along as they maintain thier original location and name.



Installation
-------------------------------------------
All formatters are installed using the Administration interface.



Upgrading from previous version
-------------------------------------------
Upgrading from version 1.0.1.0:
	All versions after this are a major rewrite. Upgrading WILL require you to rewrite all tags on all pages as the syntax has been altered.
	Original Help+Test pages should be deleted or will be automatically overwritten by never versions of the plugins.



Rights:
-------------------------------------------
I've yet to decide on a license, so until then use as you please as, but at your own risk, I will not be held responsible for any consequences of using these formatters.
Only exception is if you try to make money of my products. In which case my girlfriend, who's a state attorney will sue your ass into hell and back :S.
