Requirements:
-------------------------------------------
Theses formatters are ONLY guarenteed to work with ScrewTurn 3.0.2.509 and .Net Framework 3.5. 
However it is assumed that they will work with all 3.0.X.X versions of ScrewTurn.

Beyond that there are now special requirements.



Installation
-------------------------------------------
BlogFormatter:
	Requires that the Binaries/Themes/Blog folder is copied to the ScrewTurn /Themes/ directory

All other formatters are installed using the Administration interface.



Rights:
-------------------------------------------
I've yet to decide on a license, so until then use as you please as, but at your own risk, I will not be held responsible for any consequences of using these formatters.
Only exception is if you try to make money of my products. In which case my girlfriend, who's a state attorney will sue your ass into hell and back :S.
